## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Check Java Version**

   - Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed.
     - If not, [follow these guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html) to install Java 17 on your system.
     - **Mac users:** Use the specific JDK version from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
   - Verify installation: `java --version` in terminal
2. **Download Cerebro**

   - Download the latest `cerebro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-1/tp/releases)
   - Choose a folder as your _home folder_ for Cerebro (e.g., `~/Applications/Cerebro/`)
3. **Launch Application**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/cerebro/folder
   java -jar cerebro.jar
   ```

When Cerebro launches, you'll see a clean interface with sample data:

### CLI Tutorial

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

**Command Structure:** `COMMAND [INDEX] [PARAMETERS]` with prefixes like `n/NAME`, `s/STATUS`, `t/TAG`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning:**
All operations are permanent! No undo available.
</div>

**Typical Workflow:**

1. **Research:** `add n/CompanyName` (quick entry)
2. **Add details:** `edit 1 e/contact_email@example.com a/Sample Address #00-00`
3. **Apply:** `edit 1 s/applied r/Applied via website`
4. **View info** `find CompanyName`
5. **Interview:** `edit 1 s/tech-interview`
6. **Overview:** `filter s/KEYWORD` to filter by status, `list` to see all

**Power Tips:**

- **Batch edit/delete:** `delete 1,2,5-7` (indices 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- **Flexible input:** Parameters work in any order

### Saving the data

Cerebro data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Cerebro data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, **Cerebro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.**
<br>Furthermore, certain edits can cause Cerebro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Upcoming Features
- Archiving & backing up data files
- Undo changes
- Reminders for upcoming deadline

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I add a company with the same name?**  
**A**: Company names must be unique (case-insensitive). Cerebro rejects duplicates and shows an error message.

**Q: How do I track multiple roles at the same company?**  
**A**: Use tags to differentiate positions (`add n/Google SWE` vs `add n/Google PM`) or add role details in remarks.

**Q: Can I undo a delete or clear operation?** 
**A**: No, deletions are permanent. Restore from backup by copying your `addressbook.json` file back to the data folder before restarting.

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**  
**A**: Install Cerebro on the new computer, then overwrite the empty data file with your existing `[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json`.

**Q: Can I edit the JSON file directly?**  
**A**: Yes, advanced users can edit `addressbook.json` directly. **Always backup first** - invalid format will cause Cerebro to discard all data.

**Q: How do I regenerate the dummy data?**  
**A**: Delete the `/data` folder, then run the app again. **Make sure to backup any important information first!**
